System Workflow Pseudocode

1. When a hospitalist consult order is placed:
   - Flag the patient for potential admission.
   - Record patient details, including ID, workload, and acuity.

2. Check available units (e.g., MedSurg, PCU):
   - Compare workload and acuity for each unit.
   - Identify units with available beds and appropriate capabilities (e.g., medication support).

3. Recommend a unit:
   - Select the unit with the lowest workload and appropriate acuity level.
   - Consider specialty requirements and other filters.

4. After the hospitalist places the final admission order:
   - Verify the recommended unit matches the doctorâ€™s preferences.
   - Update the recommendation if necessary.

5. Final decision:
   - Throughput nurse or house supervisor reviews the recommendation.
   - Communicate with the assigned unit to confirm bed availability.

6. Monitor and adjust:
   - Continuously track patient flow and unit workload in real-time.
   - Update recommendations as conditions change.
